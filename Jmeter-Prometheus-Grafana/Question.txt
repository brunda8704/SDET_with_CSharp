Case Study: Performance Monitoring and Analysis with JMeter, Prometheus, and Grafana

Objective:
A large e-commerce website wants to ensure optimal performance during peak times and identify potential bottlenecks. The goal is to implement a performance monitoring solution using JMeter for load testing, Prometheus for metrics collection, and Grafana for visualization. Choose a website which has an e-commerce availability. ( amazon, bunnycart, justdogsstore, or any other)

Tasks:

Setting Up Infrastructure:
Deploy the e-commerce application in a testing environment.
Install and configure JMeter, Prometheus, and Grafana.

Load Testing with JMeter:
Design JMeter test plans to simulate realistic user scenarios, including loading the site, searching for products, and any other dunctionality available (atleast 5)
Use JMeter Recording tool.
Add necessary Configurations needed to test smoothly.
Do Assertions as deemed (atleast 5 different assertions checking various response factors)
Add listeners as needed.
Execute the load tests to measure response times, throughput, and error rates with 5 users and appropriate interval to increase user load.
Execute tests, create logs, Reports on test results.

Instrumenting the Application:
Integrate the application with Prometheus exporters to expose relevant metrics (HTTP response times, database queries, server health, etc.).

Configuring Prometheus:
Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the application's exporters.
Implement appropriate retention policies for collected metrics.

Creating Grafana Dashboards:
Connect Grafana to Prometheus as a data source.
Design Grafana dashboards that visualize key performance metrics from JMeter and application exporters.
Include panels for response times, error rates, throughput, and system resource usage.

Alerting and Monitoring:
Implement alerting rules in Prometheus based on thresholds for response times and error rates.
Configure Grafana to display and manage alerts effectively.

Analysis and Recommendations:
Analyze the collected metrics to identify performance bottlenecks during load testing. (if any and annotate)
Provide recommendations for optimizing the application based on the analysis. (if any)

Documentation:
Details of JMeter test plans.
Prometheus configuration.
Grafana dashboard designs.
