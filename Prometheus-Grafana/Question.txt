Assignment: Web Scraping and Visualization with Prometheus and Grafana

Objective:

Utilize the Blackbox Exporter to scrape details from a website and monitor its availability.
Store the scraped data in Prometheus.
Create a Grafana dashboard to visualize the website's availability and response times.

Tasks:
Setup:
Install and configure the Blackbox Exporter, Prometheus, and Grafana on your system.

Configure Blackbox Exporter:
Define a target in the Blackbox Exporter configuration to scrape a specific website.
Configure probing modules in Blackbox Exporter to check for HTTP availability and response time.

Integrate with Prometheus:
Configure Prometheus to scrape data from the Blackbox Exporter.
Ensure that scraped metrics related to the website's availability and response time are being stored in Prometheus.
Check if the Targets are being scraped from the Exporter. Document the results.
Add panels and provide multiple Prom queries and showcase them as Table/graph. Document the results.


Create Grafana Dashboard:
Connect Grafana to Prometheus as a data source.
Design a Grafana dashboard with panels that visualize the following:
Website availability (up or down status).
Response time metrics.
Additional relevant metrics that can be visulized.
Add annotations as per the results.

Alerting:
Implement alerting in Prometheus for the website's availability.
Configure Grafana to visualize and manage alerts.

Documentation:
Provide documentation that includes step-by-step instructions for setting up the entire monitoring solution.
Include screenshots of the Grafana dashboard and any configured alerts.

Submission:
Share the documentation, configuration files, and any scripts used for this assignment.
If possible, provide a brief summary of the insights gained from monitoring the website.


Note: Ensure that you choose a website that allows scraping and adhere to ethical scraping practices.
